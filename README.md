# react-webpack-es2015
**react-webpack-es2015** is just a start point for simple React based projects. It has most of the general dependencies you may need for your next `React` project such as `Webpack` (and of course some loaders!), `webpack-dev-server`, `Babel` with `ES2015(ES6)` and `ES7` presets and `ESLint`. All the things are configured and you don't need to do it again.


# Installation

You can [download](https://github.com/mamal72/react-webpack-es2015/archive/master.zip) the zip archive of repo or clone it via `git`:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mamal72/react-webpack-es2015.git
```

# Usage
There are 3 simple npm tasks. You can check them in the `package.json` but I describe them here shortly:
* **start**: Starts a [webpack-dev-server](http://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html).
* **build**: Transpile, build and bundle the app from `src` to `dist/bundle.js` directory with [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack).
* **lint**: Lint the code inside `src` directory with [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint).

# Contribution

You can fork the repository, improve or fix some part of it and then send the pull requests back if you want to see them here. I really appreciate that. :heart:

Remember to lint your code before sending pull requests. Run the npm lint task with the following command and fix the lint errors if you get any.
```bash
npm run lint
```
